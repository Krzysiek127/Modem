# Modem

Modem is a LAN chat for Windows written in C. It allows for sending text & files over a "dumb" network.
That means it doesn't need dedicated server, only a broker which broadcasts the message to every client.
A simple ncat is enough.

There will be a dedicated server which will allow for more functions but it's not even started on yet.
